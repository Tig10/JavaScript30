"# JavaScript30" 
===============

My take on [WesBos's](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30) completed solutions for the JavaScript 30 Day Challenge. It is helping me strive for daily commits and practice unopinionated JS. I also attempt to an extra feature or more where possible.

"### Drumkit"

So far just completed the JS Drumkit. Focus on DOM & INTERFACE, CSS, AUDIO FILES. This excercise maps drum sounds to specific keyboard key presses, with some visual animation when that happens. My humble addition is a crash sound from a .mp3 file to the semicolon key. Only works on Chrome though.

> Incidentally I am learning touch typing, the basics start with the keys ASDF JKL; which happen to be mapped to sounds in the excercise, made my touch typing practice fun.
